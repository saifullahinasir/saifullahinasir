        <h1>Insecurity in Zamfara State</h1>
        
        <p>Zamfara State, particularly the city of Gusau, has been facing significant security challenges. The rise in crime, banditry, and kidnapping has affected daily life, leaving residents in constant fear. The government, law enforcement, and local leaders are working together to curb this trend and improve safety for the community.
        Zamfara state is composed of 14 LGAs and its capital is Gusau. The state's estimated population was 4 515 427 in 2016.
        The conflict in Zamfara started as competition over natural resources between Hausa farmers and Fulani herders, and escalated rapidly by armed militias on both sides. In the period from 2014 to 2020, 13 out of 14 LGAs in Zamfara state experienced violence by armed groups. Actors in security incidents included local militias or armed groups from both Fulani herders and Hausa farming communities, as well as other gangs of armed criminals involved in robbery and cattle rustling. Gang violence started in Zamfara state and spilled over to neighbouring states. Moreover, Ansaru is engaging with and recruiting other splinter groups in Zamfara state. Although several military operations have been launched, their effectiveness has been questioned.

Clashes between the Nigerian military forces and local militia groups, including ground engagements and airstrikes carried out by the Nigerian Air Force, resulted in fatalities. The large majority of these fatalities were militia membero. Most of those incidents took place in Zurmi, Maru and Gusau LGAs. (Reprisal) armed attacks by unidentified gunmen, Fulani militias and suspected Yan Sakai militias against local communities resulted in civilian fatalities and abductions. For example, in February 2021, more than 300 girls were abducted from a secondary school by unknown men dressed as government security forces. Most of the girls were released
